<p><strong>Dash User Guide</strong></p>
<p>Dash was designed for online marketing agencies, with the express purpose of benefiting their customers. <br>The software provides all features for a customer of an online marketing agency to make informed choices on their investment into campaigns lead by an agency. This is made possible through a plethora of features,<br>  allowing anyone, ranging from those new to online advertising, to seasoned veterans versed in data analysis, to support all investment choices with unbiased data.</p>
<p><strong>PREREQUISITES</strong></p>
<p>Dash is based on the Java Framework. It cannot be run on machines not supporting the JVM.</p>
<p>Dash expects users to acquire log files of campaigns from their agencies. These must be stored on the same <br>machine as Dash, preferably in Dash&rsquo;s directory, but otherwise may be stored wherever the user wishes. Along with this you will be provided with necessary documents and libraries to run the application with its full features.</p>

<p><strong>1.1 Opening Dash and the Start Screen</strong></p>

<li><strong> USING THE APPLICATION</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>3.1 Loading Campaign Files</strong></p>
<p><strong>Loading Files in Dash&rsquo;s Directory</strong></p>
<p>When presented with the option to load campaign data, Dash will always check it&rsquo;s own directory first for a preloaded database and failing that, a set of correct <br>log files in a log_files directory. If a loaded campaign is found in Dash&rsquo;s directory, the application will instantly be loaded in for you. If the correct log files are located automatically then the database will immediately start loading and when finished,<br> you will be shown the main application window. If neither of these are the case then see the next section.</p>
<p><strong>Loading Files Outside Dash&rsquo;s Directory</strong></p>
<p>When loading additional campaigns into Dash, or if an initial campaign can not be found by Dash in it&rsquo;s directory, a file navigation window will appear. In the file <br>navigator, select the directory containing all log files to be loaded into Dash and click on the Load Campaign button. Dash will then load your campaign. In the event of a failure to select the correct log files, <br>Dash will inform you and offer the choice to try again or cancel the action.</p>
