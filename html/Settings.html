<h3 <a name="section">What is this section about?</a></h3>
<p>This section gives you the ability to customise your experience within Dashboard. Here you will be able to change the bounce rate definition, change the appearance, toggle database saving, find help in the documentation and read more about the developers of Dashboard.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 <a name="brief">Brief overview</a></h3>
<p></p>
<p><img src="settings.png"></p>
<p>The above diagram introduces you to the interface, labelling the key features of this section.</p>
<h3 <a name="db">Database Options</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Database Saving&nbsp;</strong>- Toggling on database saving will ensure the database is saved when the application is closed (Defaulted), while toggling off will delete the currently saved database (Warning: Even if a database had been saved in a previous session it will still be deleted if this is toggled OFF!)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="del.png"></p>
<h3 <a name="bounce">Setting the Bounce Rate Definition&nbsp;</a></h3>
<p>Dashboard allows you as a user to define how bounce rate is calculated, with the choice between:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Time spent on page</li>
<li>Number of pages visited</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="bounce.png"></p>
<h3 <a name="theme">Changing the Appearance</a></h3>
<p>Dashboard allows the customisation of themes for those who find the default colour scheme unpleasing, or plain, or simply seek some change in their life. Dashboard is pre-loaded with 4 default themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Default (The plain one, for those who seek business but no pleasure)</li>
<li>Pro (For those who understand that using vim and playing space raiders is the only proper way to use a computer)</li>
<li>Husky (The <strong>super</strong>ior theme, based on the <strong>super</strong>ior breed because its a <strong>super</strong>-visor)</li>
<li>Soft (Brings a subtleness, a softness that will match Bob Ross' happy trees)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="theme.png"></p>
<p>Furthermore, if none of these default themes are for you, Dashboard allows the creation of custom themes by selection of &nbsp;Font, Background and Hover colours.&nbsp;<br>
The image below shows: a custom theme, soft theme, pro theme and husky theme</p>

<h3 <a name="doc">Documentation</a></h3>
<p><img src="guide.png"></p>
<p>Here you will find the <em>User Manual&nbsp;</em>which is a comprehensive overview of the application on top of the in-client help provided in the help buttons. And furthermore, if you cannot find your answers in the help sections nor the user manual then we provide a "Customer Questions" section which allows you to enter your email and question.&nbsp;</p>
