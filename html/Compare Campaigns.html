<p>The picture above illustrates the functionality of the section and acts as a storyboard.</p>
<h4 <a name="import">Importing a Campaign&nbsp;</a></h4>
<p>To compare the current campaign to an external one the user has 2 options:</p>
<ul>
<li>load a folder containing the 3 CSV files: this happens by pressing<em> Add Campaign</em> button&nbsp;</li>
<p><img src="add copy.png"></p>
</ul>
<p>After that, the user locates the folder with the 3 files and presses <em>Confirm.</em> If the folder does contain the CSVs the user is asked to enter a name for his newly imported campaign. After the user enters a name, the campaign appears in the dropbox:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>load from an already existing database in the Dash system: this happens by choosing a campaign from the dropbox:

</ul>
<h4 <a name="metric">Defining the Comparison Metric</a></h4>
<p>Once the campaign has been chosen, next step is to choose the comparison metric. The metric can be chosen from the dropbox:</p>

<p>Choosing one by clicking on means that both campaigns will be compared based on that metric.</p>
<h4 <a name="gran">Defining Time Granularity</a></h4>
<p>By default, the comparison will happen by "day" but if the user wants to data to be by weeks or by month this happens by choosing the correct time granularity from the dropbox:</p>
